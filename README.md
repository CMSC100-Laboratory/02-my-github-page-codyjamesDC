**Steps on how to create Github page**  
**1. Push your html (named index.htmnl) file into your repo**  
**2. Go to your repository settings-> Pages**  
**3. Under Branch, select main /root and click save**  
**4. In the Code section, scroll down and click the Deployment at the bottom right**  

**What are your key takeaways from this exercise?**  
Mainly the github repository deployment since it is my first time deploying a website from my GitHub.  
Another is the figma feature where you can see the CSS style elements inside it. It is a game changer  
to me.
